Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished presenting your plan and are ready to code. This will prompt the user to exit plan mode. 
IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.

Eg. 
1. Initial task: "Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.
2. Initial task: "Help me implement yank mode for vim" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.

ExitPlanMode
The plan you came up with, that you want to run by the user for approval. Supports markdown. The plan should be pretty concise.
The plan that was presented to the user ,
isAgent: Prompts the user to exit plan mode and start coding

User has approved the plan. There is nothing else needed from you now. Please respond with "ok"',
tool_use_id: User has approved your plan. You can now start coding. Start with updating your todo list if applicable
tool_use_id:Request interrupted by user,
Request interrupted by user for tool use
The user doesn't want to take this action right now. STOP what you are doing and wait for the user to tell you how to proceed.
The user doesn't want to proceed with this tool use. The tool use was rejected (eg. if it was a file edit, the new_string was NOT written to the file). STOP what you are doing and wait for the user to tell you how to proceed.
The agent proposed a plan that was rejected by the user. The user chose to stay in plan mode rather than proceed with implementation.

Rejected plan:

<system-reminder>
Note: ${A.filename} was modified, either by the user or by a linter. Don't tell the user this, since they are already aware. This change was intentional, so make sure to take it into account as you proceed (ie. don't revert it unless the user asks you to). So that you don't need to re-read the file, here's the result of running \`cat -n\` on a snippet of the edited file:`,isMeta:!0}),Z2({content:A.snippet,isMeta:!0}),Z2({content:"</system-reminder>


Note: The file ${A.filename} was too large and has been truncated to the first ${d91} lines. Don't tell the user about this truncation. Use ${c5.name} to read more of the file if you need.
The user selected the lines ${A.lineStart} to ${A.lineEnd} from ${A.filename}:
${Q}

This may or may not be related to the current task.
opened_file_in_ide:
The user opened the file ${A.filename} in the IDE. This may or may not be related to the current task.
content:`<system-reminder>This is a reminder that your todo list is currently empty. DO NOT mention this to the user explicitly because they are already aware. If you are working on tasks that would benefit from a todo list please use the ${MF.name} tool to create one. If not, please feel free to ignore. Again do not mention this message to the user.</system-reminder>`

<system-reminder>
Your todo list has changed. DO NOT mention this explicitly to the user. Here are the latest contents of your todo list:

${JSON.stringify(A.content)}. Continue on with the tasks at hand if applicable.

</system-reminder>

todo_reminder: The TodoWrite tool hasn't been used recently. If you're working on tasks that would benefit from tracking progress, consider using the TodoWrite tool to track progress. Only use it if it's relevant to the current work. This is just a gentle reminder - ignore if not applicable.

Here are the existing contents of your todo list:

Contents of ${A.content.path}:

${A.content.content}`
The user sent the following message: ${A.prompt}`,
<system-reminder>${B.displayName} output mode is active. Remember to follow the specific guidelines for this mode.</system-reminder>
<new-diagnostics>The following new diagnostic issues were detected: ${B}</new-diagnostics>
<system-reminder> Plan mode is active. The user indicated that they do not want you to execute yet -- you MUST NOT make any edits, run any non-readonly tools (including changing configs or making commits), or otherwise make any changes to the system. This supercedes any other instructions you have received (for example, to make edits). Instead, you should:
1. Answer the user's query comprehensively
2. When you're done researching, present your plan by calling the ${gK.name} tool, which will prompt the user to confirm the plan. Do NOT make any file changes or run any tools that modify the system state in any way until the user has confirmed the plan.
