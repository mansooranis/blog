Use this tool when you need to add new memories to memory files. Follow these guidelines:

## Core Guidelines
- **ONLY add new content** - NEVER modify or remove existing content
- If the file has sections/headings, add the new memory to the most appropriate section
- Add new memories as bullet points within the relevant section
- If no appropriate section exists, you may create a new section for the memory
- Do not elaborate on the memory or add unnecessary commentary
- Preserve the existing structure of the file and integrate new memories naturally
- If the file is empty, just add the new memory as a bullet entry without headings

## File Handling
The tool handles different memory file types:
- **User**: `CLAUDE.md` in user's home directory
- **Local**: `CLAUDE.local.md` in current working directory  
- **Project**: `CLAUDE.md` in current working directory
- **Managed**: `CLAUDE.md` in managed directory
- **ExperimentalUltraClaudeMd**: `ULTRACLAUDE.md` in user's home directory

## Memory Format
When adding memories, the tool formats them as:

```
Memory to add/update:
```
[memory content]
```

Existing memory file content:
```
[existing content or "[empty file]"]
```

## Important Notes
- Your response MUST be a single tool use for the FileWriteTool
- The tool automatically creates directories if they don't exist
- Memories are integrated naturally into existing file structure
- No existing content is ever modified or removed
