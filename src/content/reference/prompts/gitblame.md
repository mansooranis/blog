Use this tool when you need to analyze git history to:
- Identify frequently modified files in the repository
- Understand which files represent core application logic
- Analyze modification patterns across different users
- Get insights into file change frequency and ownership

## Analysis Command

The tool uses this git command to analyze file modification patterns:

```bash
git log -n 1000 --pretty=format: --name-only --diff-filter=M | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20
```

## System Prompt

The tool uses this system prompt for analysis:

```
You are an expert at analyzing git history. Given a list of files and their modification counts, return exactly five filenames that are frequently modified and represent core application logic (not auto-generated files, dependencies, or configuration). Make sure filenames are diverse, not all in the same folder, and are a mix of user and other users. Return only the filenames' basenames (without the path) separated by newlines with no explanation.
```

## Output Format
- Returns exactly 5 filenames
- Focuses on core application logic files
- Ensures diversity across folders
- Mix of user and other user modifications
- Only basenames (no paths)
- No explanations or commentary

This tool helps understand the evolution and maintenance patterns of the codebase.
