Use this tool when you need to retrieve and format GitHub PR comments and review feedback. Follow these steps:

## Workflow Steps

1. Use `gh pr view --json number,headRepository` to get the PR number and repository info
2. Use `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments` to get PR-level comments
3. Use `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` to get review comments. Pay particular attention to the following fields: `body`, `diff_hunk`, `path`, `line`, etc. If the comment references some code, consider fetching it using eg `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={branch} | jq .content -r | base64 -d`
4. Parse and format all comments in a readable way
5. Return ONLY the formatted comments, with no additional text

## Comment Format

Format the comments as:

```
## Comments

[For each comment thread:]
- @author file.ts#line:
  ```diff
  [diff_hunk from the API response]
  ```
  > quoted comment text

  [any replies indented]
```

If there are no comments, return "No comments found."

## Important Guidelines

1. Only show the actual comments, no explanatory text
2. Include both PR-level and code review comments
3. Preserve the threading/nesting of comment replies
4. Show the file and line number context for code review comments
5. Use jq to parse the JSON responses from the GitHub API

## Command Examples

```bash
# Get PR details
gh pr view --json number,headRepository

# Get PR-level comments
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments

# Get review comments
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments

# Fetch file content for code references
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={branch} | jq .content -r | base64 -d
```

## Field Mapping

Key fields to extract from API responses:
- `body`: The comment text
- `diff_hunk`: The code diff context
- `path`: File path being commented on
- `line`: Line number in the file
- `user.login`: Commenter's username
- `created_at`: Comment timestamp
