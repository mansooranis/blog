Ever wondered how Claude Code manages to be so much more than just a chat interface? How it can actually execute commands, analyze code, and work with your filesystem intelligently? The secret lies in a sophisticated collection of **system tools** that transform Claude from a conversational AI into a powerful coding agent.

In this blog post I will reveal the exact system prompts Claude code uses. I dug through Claude's compiled source code and found more than 25 system tool prompts. I will also explain how these tools are beneficial and can be used to our advantage.

## What Makes Agentic AI Actually Work?

So, what exactly is agentic AI?.Think of Agentic AI as a highly skilled developer who can do the following:

- Execute commands in the terminal
- Analyze and modify code intelligently
- Search through codebases efficiently
- Provide educational insights while working
- Collaborate with you on complex tasks

But here's the thing: without the right system tools, an AI agent is just a very knowledgeable parrot. The real power comes from the specialized prompts that tell Agents *how* to use its capabilities safely and effectively.

## The System Tool Arsenal

Let me walk you through the comprehensive toolkit that makes Claude Code so powerful along with links to its system prompts:

### **Execution Tools**

#### 1. **Execute Bash Commands** [(link)](/references/prompts/execute-bash-commands/)
This is the workhorse tool that actually runs commands in your terminal with the ability to sandbox commands when needed adding aditional security.

```bash
# Claude knows to use sandbox=true for read-only operations
ls -la src/components/  # Runs immediately, no approval needed

# But switches to sandbox=false for operations that modify files
npm run build  # Requires explicit approval
```

#### 2. **Analyze Bash Commands** [(link)](/references/prompts/analyze-bash-command)
Before executing commands, Claude analyzes them to determine if the output should be summarized. This prevents you from drowning in verbose logs:

```xml
<should_summarize>true</should_summarize>
<reason>Output contains verbose build logs with only final status being important</reason>
<summary>
## Overview
Build completed successfully with 2 warnings

## Errors
- Warning: Unused import in utils.ts
- Warning: Missing type annotation in helper.ts

## Verbatim Output
âœ“ Build completed in 2.3s
</summary>
```

### **Intelligence & Learning Tools**

#### 3. **Insights & Learn by Doing** [(link)](/references/prompts/insights)
This tool transforms Claude from a code executor into an educational partner. It provides insights about implementation choices and encourages collaborative learning:

```
ðŸ’¡ **Insight â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€**
â€¢ Using React.memo here prevents unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed
â€¢ The custom hook pattern separates business logic from UI concerns
â€¢ TypeScript's discriminated unions ensure type safety across different states
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
```

#### 4. **Plan and Ready to Code** [(link)](/references/prompts/plan-and-ready-to-code)
Before diving into implementation, Claude creates structured plans and validates that the environment is ready:

```
ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Plan**
1. Set up component structure with TypeScript interfaces
2. Implement core logic with error handling
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Update documentation

âœ… **Environment Check**
- TypeScript compiler available
- Test framework configured
- Required dependencies installed
```

### **Search & Discovery Tools**

#### 5. **Fast File Matching** [(link)](/references/prompts/fast-file-matching-tool)
Instead of slow `find` commands, Claude uses optimized file matching:

```
**File Search Results**
Found 15 TypeScript files matching pattern: **/*.ts
- src/components/Button.tsx
- src/utils/helpers.ts
- src/types/index.ts
```

#### 6. **Extract File Paths** [(link)](/references/prompts/extract-file-paths)
Intelligently extracts and validates file paths from various sources:

```
**Extracted Paths**
- Valid: src/components/Header.tsx
- Valid: public/images/logo.svg
- Invalid: /etc/passwd (security restriction)
```

### **Knowledge Management Tools**

#### 7. **Memory System** [(link)](/references/prompts/memory)
Claude can remember important information across sessions and reference it when relevant:

```
**Memory Context**
Previous session: Implemented user authentication system
Key decisions: Used JWT tokens, bcrypt for password hashing
Current task: Adding password reset functionality
```

#### 8. **Session Snapshots** [(link)](/references/prompts/save-session-snapshot)
Save the current state of your work session for later reference:

```
**Session Snapshot Saved**
- Current working directory: /project/src
- Open files: 3
- Recent commands: 15
- Context: Building React component library
```

### **Workflow Tools**

#### 9. **Create Workflow** [(link)](/references/prompts/create-workflow)
Claude can create sophisticated CI/CD workflows:

```yaml
# Claude automatically generates this GitHub Actions workflow
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]

jobs:
  claude:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Claude Code
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
```

#### 10. **Launch New Agent** [(link)](/references/prompts/launch-new-agent)
When a task requires specialized knowledge, Claude can launch specialized agents:

```
**Launching Specialized Agent**
Agent: Code Review Specialist
Focus: Security analysis, performance optimization
Context: Pull request #123 with database schema changes
```

### **Utility & Helper Tools**

#### 11. **Multiple Edits** [(link)](/references/prompts/multiple-edits)
Handle complex refactoring across multiple files:

```
**Multi-File Edit Plan**
- Update interface in types.ts
- Modify implementation in service.ts
- Update tests in service.test.ts
- Fix imports in index.ts
```

#### 12. **Todo List Tool** [(link)](/references/prompts/todo-list-tool)
This is my favourite tool where Claude can track complex tasks with dependencies and progress:

```
**Todo List**
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Install dependencies
- [ ] Implement core functionality
  - [ ] User authentication
  - [ ] Data validation
  - [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Deploy to staging
```

### **Other Tools**
Here are the remaining tool prompts that I did not mention above:

- [Elite AI Agent Architect System Prompt](/references/prompts/elite-ai)
- [Code Review Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/code-review)
- [General Purpose Agent System Prompt](/references/prompts/general)
- [Git Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/git)
- [Git Blame Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/gitblame)
- [Initialize CLAUDE.md Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/init-claude)
- [MCP Server Tools System Prompt](/references/prompts/mcp)
- [Multiple Edits Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/multiple-edits)
- [Notebook Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/notebook)
- [Shell Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/shelltool)
- [Read PDFs and Jupyter Notebooks tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/read-pdf-jupyter-notebooks)

- [Summarize and Clear Conversation Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/summarize-and-clear)
- [Use Tools System Prompt](/references/prompts/usetools)
- [Web Search Tool System Prompt](/references/prompts/websearch)

## How These Tools Work Together

The beauty of this system is how the tools complement each other. Here's a real-world example:

### Scenario: Implementing a New Feature

1. **Plan and Ready to Code** â†’ Creates implementation plan and validates environment
2. **Fast File Matching** â†’ Finds relevant existing code
3. **Execute Bash Commands** â†’ Runs tests and builds
4. **Analyze Bash Commands** â†’ Summarizes verbose output
5. **Multiple Edits** â†’ Makes changes across multiple files
6. **Insights** â†’ Provides educational context
7. **Memory** â†’ Remembers decisions for future reference

## How is this useful to me?
You can you use these examples to maximize the utilization of these tools by good prompting. This also provides a base foundation for others developers to create even better and pwoerful tools. 

## Final Thoughts
I hope this is useful information to you. Full disclaimer: I did use AI to clean the system prompts. Even with AI it took me a week to find, extract, and process all the information into a single place.
